# Dishwasher-Control-System-Simulation
This project was developed in C as part of a Digital Electronics (PHYS 230) course at SUNY Geneseo (October 2023). It was designed using Arduino, digital logic components, an analog/digital trainer, and C programming in the Arduino IDE. The system features binary wash cycle tracking, programmed wash sequences, and fully wired component integration.
